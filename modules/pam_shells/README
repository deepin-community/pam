pam_shells — PAM module to check for valid login shell

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_shells is a PAM module that only allows access to the system if the user's
shell is listed in /etc/shells.

If this file does not exist, entries are taken from files %vendordir%/shells,
%vendordir%/shells.d/* and /etc/shells.d/* in that order.

It also checks if needed files (e.g. /etc/shells) are plain files and not world
writable.

OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.
